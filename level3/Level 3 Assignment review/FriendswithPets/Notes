<!-- ## Objective

Create a React app that displays a list of friends and their pets. This assignment will help you practice creating components, using props, and rendering lists dynamically in React.

### Requirements

The final product should render a list of friends. Each friend should be displayed with their name and age, followed by a list of their pets. Each pet should be displayed with its name and breed.

### Instructions

1. **Project Setup:**
    - Start a new React project or use an existing one.
    - Create the following components: `<FriendList />`, `<Friend />`, and `<Pet />`.
2. **Data Provided:**
Use the following data to populate your components:
    
    ```jsx
    const friends = [
      {
        name: "Ben",
        age: 29,
        pets: [
          { name: "spot", breed: "tabby" },
          { name: "John Johnson", breed: "husky" },
          { name: "Bear the bear", breed: "Grizzly" }
        ]
      },
      {
        name: "Bob",
        age: 31,
        pets: [{ name: "Sally", breed: "Australian Shepard" }]
      },
      {
        name: "Marcus",
        age: 25,
        pets: [
          { name: "Indy", breed: "Akita" },
          { name: "Anna", breed: "persian cat" }
        ]
      },
      {
        name: "Jacob",
        age: 20,
        pets: [
          { name: "fluffy", breed: "sphynx cat" },
          { name: "patches", breed: "sphynx cat" },
          { name: "tiger", breed: "sphynx cat" },
          { name: "oscar", breed: "sphynx cat" }
        ]
      }
    ];
    
    ```
    
3. **Styling:**
    - Use appropriate HTML (JSX) tags and CSS to ensure the app is visually appealing and easy to read.
4. **Verification:**
    - Check that the app displays each friend with their pets listed underneath them, as specified.
    - Ensure that the data is rendered accurately according to the provided structure.

By completing this assignment, you will strengthen your skills in managing component hierarchy and rendering lists in React. -->
